So?


Are you ready, Dust?


Are you ready to leave yourself behind?
You could find comfort in our embrace if you would.


But i see that is not what you want.

So raise, reborn, take a new life, new possibilitis.

We will stay here...

In the darkness..

Waiting for your return...



For that is our curse.
